# WKP7 - Library

## 1. In a few sentences,  explain the structure of your project.

- First I created the three array inside of an Object. 
- I created an empty array and I push the new book into the new empty array.
- I store them in the local storage so that the user can access their book when they come back later
- After that I did the checkbox if the book has been read or not. If it has been read the checkbox is checked, but if not the checkbox is unchecked.

## 2. If you had more time, what area of your project would you improve?

If I had more time, the area of my project that I would improve is the delete button because I didn't get it work as it suppose to be.

## 3. Did you learn anything new while working on this project?

Not really, but I can say that it helps me a lot to really understand how the map works. Not only that but also it trains me to aware of how to store an item in the local storage using new Custom event.

## 4. What was the most challenging part for you?

Most of them are challenging but the delete button and the checkbox are the most challenging part for me.

## 5. Would you like a new explanation about a specific topic?

Absolutely, I really need more explanation about these few things below:

- new Custom event
- to delete the array from the local storage or from the object. Because, I only get it deleted from the browser but not from the object.
- to change the status when the checkbox is checked or unchecked.

## 6. Any other comments?

I don't have much to say apart from that. But I appreciate what you have done for us. Thank you for your hard working.
